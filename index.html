            <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo">
                Off the field, Ronaldo is known for his philanthropy and has donated millions to various charities and causes.
                In 2009, Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother's life in Madeira following her battle with cancer, 
                so that they could build a cancer centre on the island.[248]
                In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood, 
                Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto 
                and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional.
